## Number Guessing Game 😍

A simple C programming game where you guess the number chosen by the computer.  
I built this as part of my C programming learning journey.  
Inspired by CodeWithHarry’s tutorial.

2. You will try to guess the number.
3. The program will give hints if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
5. The program also counts how many guesses you made.
