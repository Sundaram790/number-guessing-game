# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

A simple C programming game where you guess the number chosen by the computer.  
I built this as part of my C programming learning journey.  
Inspired by CodeWithHarryâ€™s tutorial.

## ðŸ“œ How to Play
1. The computer will randomly select a number within a range.
2. You will try to guess the number.
3. The program will give hints if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
5. The program also counts how many guesses you made.
